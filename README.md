# Code used for the paper: "Automatic and explainable grading of meningioma from histopathology images"

The repository contains the models described in the above paper (Model1.py, Model2.py, Model3.py) as well as the training and inference scripts used in the paper. Unfortunately, the data used in the paper cannot be made public at this time. 
The [results](https://github.com/JonaGanz/automatic_meningioma_grading/tree/main/results) folder contains all resutls which we achieved with our trained models. The [models](https://github.com/JonaGanz/automatic_meningioma_grading/tree/main/models) folder contains one Model1, Model2 and Model3 each which were all trained with the same training split. For space reasons not all models could be uploaded.
The utils.py contains code to calculate the mAP and was adapted from [here](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection).
